// Cool project! I love the idea itself, it would be really useful if you put all the data you have in Neon db and allow users to add more. It would be a real tool for a lot of people!

// Of course I couldn't test much as my tables are empty, but still very good job! I like that you practiced db connection and server setup. Project works really well. And thank you for the database.sql file! I would also like to note that it is good that you used .gitignore. 

// As an impovement I would suggest you give me a choice of medicine while typing in search input.

// The functionality works very well and I really wish you deploy the project with Neon DB :)
